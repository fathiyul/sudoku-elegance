1. Install Node.js and npm:
   - Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system
   - This installation will include npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Verify the installation:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   These commands should display the versions of Node.js and npm respectively.

3. Create a new React project:
   We'll use Create React App, which is a popular tool for setting up React projects with a good default configuration.

   In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:
   ```
   npx create-react-app sudoku-react
   ```
   This command creates a new folder named "sudoku-react" with a basic React project structure.

4. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```
   cd sudoku-react
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command starts the development server and should automatically open your default browser to `http://localhost:3000`, where you'll see the default React app page.

6. Open the project in your code editor:
   You can now open the "sudoku-react" folder in your preferred code editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm).

Your development environment is now set up and ready for building the Sudoku game. The main files you'll be working with are in the `src` folder:

- `src/App.js`: This is the main component where you'll start building your game.
- `src/index.js`: This is the entry point of your React application.
- `src/App.css`: This is where you can add your custom styles.

Would you like to move on to the next step of planning the component structure, or do you have any questions about the setup process?
