Here's a step-by-step plan to build a Sudoku game using React:

1. Set up your development environment:
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Create a new React project using Create React App or a similar tool

2. Plan your component structure:
   - SudokuGame (main component)
   - Board
   - Cell
   - Controls (for new game, solve, etc.)

3. Create the basic UI components:
   - Implement the Board component to render a 9x9 grid
   - Create the Cell component for individual squares
   - Design a simple layout for the game

4. Implement game logic:
   - Create functions to generate a valid Sudoku puzzle
   - Develop logic to check if a move is valid
   - Implement a solver algorithm (optional, for a "solve" feature)

5. Manage game state:
   - Use React state to store the current game board
   - Track user inputs and update the board accordingly

6. Add user interactions:
   - Implement input handling for number entry
   - Add functionality for selecting cells

7. Implement game controls:
   - Add a "New Game" button to generate a new puzzle
   - Include difficulty levels (optional)
   - Add a "Check" button to validate the current board state

8. Enhance the user experience:
   - Add visual feedback for correct/incorrect moves
   - Implement a timer (optional)
   - Add animations for a more polished feel

9. Optimize performance:
   - Use React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate for cells that don't change frequently
   - Consider using a state management library like Redux if the app grows complex

10. Test your application:
    - Write unit tests for your game logic
    - Perform thorough manual testing

11. Style your game:
    - Apply CSS to make your game visually appealing
    - Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes

12. Deploy your game:
    - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
    - Set up the deployment process
